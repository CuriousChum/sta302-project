Work on your own files to prevent git conflict craziness. Try to not make changes to others' file.

If you remember how to branch and merge, feel free to do so.

Commands:
Initial branching setup (if you decide to do so)
```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
git push -u origin <branch_name>
```

When pushing, remember to pull if working on main
```bash
git pull
# if there are conflicts resolve them, don't force push
git push
```
